Colorification is a program designed to notify a user when a pixel on the screen alters colors. 
Instructions: 
Until I have created an exe file, please be sure to have Python 3.8, Tkinter, Pyautogui, and win32api installed. 
  1. Download and extract the Colorification file from GitHub.
  2. Run the file COlorification.py
  3. (Optional) Use the "Get mouse position" button to get the current position and pixel color that the mouse is currently hovering over.
     There is a 3 second delay after the button is pressed before logging the position and pixel color giving you time to move your mouse
     to your desired location.
  4. Fill out each text box with your desired information. 
  5. Press Start to begin scanning. A notification will appear on the bottom left of the program when the desired pixel color is found!
  6. Press Stop to end the scan at any time.
  
  Notes: 
      - Seconds should be in int format. ex. input "1" for a 1 second delay. 
      - Colors are in RGB format surrounded in parentheses. ex: (49, 184, 198)
      - Fill out the X and Y coordinate in separate boxes.
